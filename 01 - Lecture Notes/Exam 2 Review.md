### Collections Interface

* Know these: Deque, Queue, List Set
* Make a cheat sheet that has abstract lists
    + AbstractSet
    + ArraySet
    + ArrayList
    + Hashmap
    + LinkedList
    + TreeSet
    + Vetor?
    + Stack
        + First in last out
    + Sets
        + Abstract
        + 

### What list to use

* If you do not need to change the size, then `ArrayList`
* If you need to change at beginning and end, then `LinkedList`

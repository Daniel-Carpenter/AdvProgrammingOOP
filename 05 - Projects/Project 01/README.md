# Project 1: String and Date/Time

## Understanding of the Problem 

* Within this Java Project, the program allows the user to calculate the 
`Hamming Distance` of two given stations. According to the project description,
the Hamming Distance is the "distance between two strings of equal length;
it calculates the "number of positions at which the corresponding symbols 
are different." For example, if the two Strings are contain the same characters
in the same sequence, then the Hamming Distance will be 0. Alternatively, if 
the characters do not match at in sequence, the hamming distance will equal the
number of characters in the string, i.e. 4. See example below for more:

| char 1 | char 2 | char 3 | char 4 |  Hamming Distance |
|:------:|:------:|:------:|:------:|:-----------------:|
|    R   |    O   |    C   |    K   |                   |
|    R   |    O   |    F   |    L   |                   |
|    0   |    0   |    1   |    1   | 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 = 2 |



* Additionally, the user will understand how Java date and time formats work.
